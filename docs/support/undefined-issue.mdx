# Error Code: `Undefined Issue`

To troubleshoot an "undefined" issue in Jan:

- Try clearing the Jan folder and reopening the app to see if the problem persists.
- If it does, manually run the nitro tool located at `~/jan/extensions/@janhq/inference-nitro-extensions/dist/bin/(your-os)/nitro` to check for error messages.
- Address any nitro error messages and reassess the issue's persistence.
- Reopen Jan to see if the problem is resolved.
- If the issue persists, please share the [app logs](https://jan.ai/troubleshooting/how-to-get-error-logs/) via [Jan Discord](https://discord.gg/mY69SZaMaC).
