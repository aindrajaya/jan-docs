# Error Code: `Unexpected Token`

If you see the error `Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE"...is not valid JSON` when starting a chat with OpenAI models:

- Add an OpenAI API key from [OpenAI's developer platform](https://platform.openai.com/), or download a free local model from Jan Hub to run on your computer.
- Trying a VPN could potentially solve the issue.
