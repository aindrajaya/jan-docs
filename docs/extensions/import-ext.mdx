# Import Extensions

Besides default extensions, you can import extensions into Jan by navigating to Settings > Extensions > Manual Installation. Then, the ~/jan/extensions/extensions.json file will be updated automatically.

<div class="text--center"> 
    <img src={extensionsURL} width={600} alt="jan-ai-extensions" />
</div>
