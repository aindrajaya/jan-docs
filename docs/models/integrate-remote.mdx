# Remote Server Integration

:::warning

This is currently under development.

:::

This guide will show you how to configure Jan as a client and point it to any remote & local (self-hosted) API server.

## OpenAI Platform Configuration

### 1. Create a Model JSON

In `~/jan/models`, create a folder named `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k`.

In this folder, add a `model.json` file with Filename as `model.json`, `id` matching folder name, `Format` as `api`, `Engine` as `openai`, and `State` as `ready`.


```json title="~/jan/models/gpt-3.5-turbo-16k/model.json"
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "filename": "openai",
      "url": "https://openai.com"
    }
  ],
  "id": "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k",
  "object": "model",
  "name": "OpenAI GPT 3.5 Turbo 16k",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "OpenAI GPT 3.5 Turbo 16k model is extremely good",
  "format": "api",
  "settings": {},
  "parameters": {},
  "metadata": {
    "author": "OpenAI",
    "tags": ["General", "Big Context Length"]
  },
  "engine": "openai"
}
```

:::tip

 - You can find the list of available models in the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview).
 - The `id` property needs to match the model name in the list.
   - For example, if you want to use the [GPT-4 Turbo](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo), you must set the `id` property to `gpt-4-1106-preview`.

### 2. Configure OpenAI API Keys

You can find your API keys in the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and set the OpenAI API keys in `~/jan/engines/openai.json` file.

```json title="~/jan/engines/openai.json"
{
  "full_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
  "api_key": "sk-<your key here>"
}
```

### 3. Start the Model

Restart Jan and navigate to the Hub. Then, select your configured model and start the model.

## Engines with OAI Compatible Configuration

This section will show you how to configure a client connection to a remote/local server using Jan's API server running model `mistral-ins-7b-q4` as an example.

:::note

Currently, you can only connect to one OpenAI-compatible endpoint at a time.

:::

### 1. Configure a Client Connection

Navigate to the `~/jan/engines` folder and modify the `openai.json file`. Please note that currently, the code that supports any OpenAI-compatible endpoint only reads `engine/openai.json` file. Thus, it will not search any other files in this directory.

Configure `full_url` properties with the endpoint server that you want to connect. For example, if you're going to communicate to Jan's API server, you can configure it as follows:

```json title="~/jan/engines/openai.json"
{
  // "full_url": "https://<server-ip-address>:<port>/v1/chat/completions"
  "full_url": "https://<server-ip-address>:1337/v1/chat/completions"
  // Skip api_key if your local server does not require authentication
  // "api_key": "sk-<your key here>"
}
```

### 2. Create a Model JSON

In `~/jan/models`, create a folder named `mistral-ins-7b-q4`.

In this folder, add a `model.json` file with Filename as `model.json`, `id` matching folder name, `Format` as `api`, `Engine` as `openai`, and `State` as `ready`.


```json title="~/jan/models/mistral-ins-7b-q4/model.json"
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "filename": "janai",
      "url": "https://jan.ai"
    }
  ],
  "id": "mistral-ins-7b-q4",
  "object": "model",
  "name": "Mistral Instruct 7B Q4 on Jan API Server",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Jan integration with remote Jan API server",
  "format": "api",
  "settings": {},
  "parameters": {},
  "metadata": {
    "author": "MistralAI, The Bloke",
    "tags": ["remote", "awesome"]
  },
  "engine": "openai"
}
```

### 3. Start the Model

Restart Jan and navigate to the Hub. Locate your model and click the Use button.
