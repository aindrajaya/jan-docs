# Jan Integration for OpenRouter

## Overview

This guide demonstrates integrating OpenRouter with Jan, allowing you to utilize remote LLMs accessible through OpenRouter.

### What is **OpenRouter**?

[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/docs#quick-start) is a tool that gathers AI models. Developers can utilize its API to engage with diverse large language models, generative image models, and generative 3D object models.

## Steps for Integration

### Step 1: Configure OpenRouter API key

You can find your API keys in the OpenRouter API Key and set the OpenRouter API key in `~/jan/engines/openai.json` file.

### Step 2: Modify a Model JSON

Go to the directory ~/jan/models. Make a new folder called openrouter-(modelname), like openrouter-dolphin-mixtral-8x7b, and inside it, create a model.json file with the specified settings.

 - Make sure the filename is model.json.
 - Set the id property to the model id obtained from OpenRouter.
 - Set the format property to api.
 - Set the engine property to openai.
 - Ensure the state property is set to ready.

```json title="~/jan/models/openrouter-dolphin-mixtral-8x7b/model.json"
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "filename": "openrouter",
      "url": "https://openrouter.ai/"
    }
  ],
  "id": "cognitivecomputations/dolphin-mixtral-8x7b",
  "object": "model",
  "name": "Dolphin 2.6 Mixtral 8x7B",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "This is a 16k context fine-tune of Mixtral-8x7b. It excels in coding tasks due to extensive training with coding data and is known for its obedience, although it lacks DPO tuning. The model is uncensored and is stripped of alignment and bias. It requires an external alignment layer for ethical use. Users are cautioned to use this highly compliant model responsibly, as detailed in a blog post about uncensored models at erichartford.com/uncensored-models.",
  "format": "api",
  "settings": {},
  "parameters": {},
  "metadata": {
    "tags": ["General", "Big Context Length"]
  },
  "engine": "openai"
}
```
 
### Step 3 : Start the Model

Restart Jan and go to the Hub. Find your model and click on the Use button.
