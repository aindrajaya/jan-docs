# Jan Integration for Azure Raycast

## Overview

This guide will show you how to integrate Azure OpenAI Service with Jan.

### What is *Azure OpenAI*?

The [Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/overview?source=docs) offers robust APIs, making it simple for you to incorporate OpenAI's language models into your applications.

## Steps for Integration

### Step 1: Configure Azure OpenAI Service API Key

Once you've set up and deployed Azure OpenAI Service, you can find the endpoint and API key in [Azure OpenAI Studio](https://oai.azure.com/) under `Chat` > `View code`.

Set up the endpoint and API key for Azure OpenAI Service in the `~/jan/engines/openai.json` file.

```json title="~/jan/engines/openai.json"
{
  // https://hieujan.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/gpt-35-hieu-jan/chat/completions?api-version=2023-07-01-preview
  "full_url": "https://<your-resource-name>.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/<your-deployment-name>/chat/completions?api-version=<api-version>",
  "api_key": "<your-api-key>"
}
```

### Step 2: Modify a Model JSON

Go to the `~/jan/models` directory. Make a new folder called `(your-deployment-name)`, like `gpt-35-hieu-jan`, and inside that folder, create a `model.json` file with the specified configurations:

 - Ensure the file is named `model.json`.
 - Match the `id` property with both the folder name and your deployment name.
 - Set the `format` property as `api`.
 - Choose `openai` for the `engine` property.
 - Set the `state` property as `ready`.

```json title="~/jan/models/gpt-35-hieu-jan/model.json"
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "filename": "azure_openai",
      "url": "https://hieujan.openai.azure.com"
    }
  ],
  "id": "gpt-35-hieu-jan",
  "object": "model",
  "name": "Azure OpenAI GPT 3.5",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Azure Open AI GPT 3.5 model is extremely good",
  "format": "api",
  "settings": {},
  "parameters": {},
  "metadata": {
    "author": "OpenAI",
    "tags": ["General", "Big Context Length"]
  },
  "engine": "openai"
}
```

### Step 3: Start the Model

Restart Jan and go to the Hub. Find your model and click on the Use button.
