## Error Code `Something's Amiss`

Encountering a "Something's amiss" response when starting a chat with a model, previously labeled as the "Failed to fetch" error, can have various causes. Here's how to resolve it:

### 1. Update Your Operating System

Ensure your Mac, Windows, or Ubuntu OS is up to date, as this resolves the issue for many users.

### 2. Optimize Model Size

Choose a model smaller than 80% of your hardware's V/RAM. For example, on an 8GB machine, opt for models smaller than 6GB.

### 3. Install Latest Nightly Release or Clear Cache

Install the latest [Nightly release](https://jan.ai/install/nightly/) or [clear the application cache](https://jan.ai/troubleshooting/stuck-on-broken-build/) when reinstalling Jan.

### 4. Check V/RAM Accessibility

Confirm your V/RAM accessibility, particularly if using virtual RAM.

### 5. Nvidia GPU Users

Nvidia GPU users should download [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).

### 6. Linux Users

Linux users, ensure your system meets the requirements of gcc 11, g++ 11, cpp 11, or higher. Refer to this [link](https://jan.ai/guides/troubleshooting/gpu-not-used/#specific-requirements-for-linux) for details.

### 7. Check App Logs

When [checking app logs](https://jan.ai/troubleshooting/how-to-get-error-logs/), encountering the "Bind address failed at 127.0.0.1:3928" error indicates the Nitro port may already be in use. Use specific commands to verify the port status:

        netstat -an | grep 3928
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>
        ```sh
        netstat -ano | find "3928" 
        tasklist /fi "PID eq 3928"
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux" default>
        ```sh
        netstat -anpe | grep "3928" 
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
