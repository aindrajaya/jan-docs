# Unexpected Token

Encountering the `Unexpected token` error when initiating a chat with OpenAI models mainly caused by either your OpenAI key or where you access your OpenAI from. This issue can be solved through the following steps:

1. Obtain an OpenAI API key from [OpenAI's developer platform](https://platform.openai.com/) and integrate it into your application.

2. Trying a VPN could potentially solve the issue, especially if it's related to region locking for accessing OpenAI services. By connecting through a VPN, you may bypass such restrictions and successfully initiate chats with OpenAI models.
