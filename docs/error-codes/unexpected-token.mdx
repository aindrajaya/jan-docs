# Unexpected Token

Encountering the error `Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE"...is not valid JSON` when initiating a chat with OpenAI models can be addressed through the following steps:

1. Obtain an OpenAI API key from [OpenAI's developer platform](https://platform.openai.com/) and integrate it into your application.

2. Trying a VPN could potentially solve the issue, especially if it's related to region locking for accessing OpenAI services. By connecting through a VPN, you may bypass such restrictions and successfully initiate chats with OpenAI models.

By following these steps, you can effectively resolve the "Unexpected Token" error and seamlessly start chats with OpenAI models.
