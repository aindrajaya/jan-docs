# Error Code: `Unexpected Token`

Encountering the error `Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE"...is not valid JSON` when initiating a chat with OpenAI models can be addressed through the following steps:

#### 1. Add OpenAI API Key

Obtain an OpenAI API key from [OpenAI's developer platform](https://platform.openai.com/) and integrate it into your application. Alternatively, you can download a free local model from Jan Hub to run on your computer.

#### 2. Consider Using a VPN

Trying a VPN could potentially solve the issue, especially if it's related to region locking for accessing OpenAI services. By connecting through a VPN, you may bypass such restrictions and successfully initiate chats with OpenAI models.

By following these steps, you can effectively resolve the "Unexpected Token" error and seamlessly start chats with OpenAI models.
